        <p>My name is Mark.
             Im intrested in studying programming and mechatronics.
             Hi, I'm someone who loves all things tech! I enjoy programming and building software that works smoothly, and I get a kick out of testing to make sure everything runs without glitches. I’m always excited to solve problems and learn new programming languages or techniques.

In addition to coding, I’m also really into mechatronics—it’s all about combining mechanics, electronics, and computers to make cool, functional projects. I find it fascinating to create systems that involve both hardware and software, like robots or automated machines.

Overall, I’m just passionate about tinkering with technology, whether it’s writing code, fixing bugs, or experimenting with gadgets. I’m still learning, but I’m always eager to take on new challenges and explore how things work!</p>
